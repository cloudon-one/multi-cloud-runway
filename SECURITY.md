| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| dev     | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Standards Compliance

This infrastructure implements the following security frameworks:

- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Center for Internet Security configuration standards
- **AWS Security Best Practices**: Well-Architected Framework security pillar
- **GCP Security Best Practices**: Google Cloud security foundations

## Security Architecture

### Network Security

- **Private Subnets**: All compute resources deployed in private subnets
- **Network Segmentation**: Environment and application-level isolation
- **VPN Connectivity**: Secure site-to-site connectivity for hybrid deployments
- **Firewall Rules**: Principle of least privilege network access controls
- **Transit Gateway**: Centralized routing with security inspection

### Identity and Access Management

- **IAM Roles**: Service-specific roles with minimal required permissions
- **Cross-Account Access**: Secure delegation using assumable roles
- **Workload Identity**: GCP workload identity federation for secure service authentication
- **MFA Enforcement**: Multi-factor authentication required for administrative access
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of user permissions and roles

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using cloud-native KMS services
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all data transmission
- **Key Management**: Centralized key management using AWS KMS and Google Cloud KMS
- **Backup Encryption**: All backups encrypted with separate key rotation
- **Database Security**: Private endpoints, SSL connections, and audit logging

### Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudTrail/Audit Logs**: Comprehensive API activity logging
- **Security Monitoring**: GuardDuty and Security Command Center integration
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with retention policies
- **Alerting**: Real-time security event notifications
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance status reporting

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@cloudon.work**

Include the following information:
- Description of the potential vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution Target**: 30 days for critical, 90 days for others

### Security Testing

We encourage responsible security research including:

- **Static Analysis**: Regular code security scanning
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments
- **Compliance Audits**: Quarterly internal compliance reviews
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated infrastructure scanning

## Security Controls Implementation

### Critical Security Controls

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Required for all administrative access
   - Hardware tokens recommended for production

2. **Network Access Controls**
   - Private subnets for all workloads
   - Bastion hosts for administrative access
   - VPN-only access to management interfaces

3. **Data Encryption**
   - AES-256 encryption for data at rest
   - TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
   - Separate encryption keys per environment

4. **Audit Logging**
   - All API calls logged and retained
   - Log integrity protection enabled
   - Real-time log monitoring and alerting

5. **Access Management**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular access certification

### Environment-Specific Controls

#### Production Environments
- **Deletion Protection**: Enabled for all critical resources
- **Backup Retention**: Minimum 30 days with cross-region replication
- **Change Management**: Peer review required for all changes
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring and alerting enabled

#### Development/Staging Environments  
- **Cost Controls**: Resource limits and automatic shutdown
- **Data Masking**: Production data anonymization
- **Time-bound Access**: Temporary elevated permissions

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **P0 - Critical**: Active security breach or data exposure
- **P1 - High**: Potential security vulnerability with high impact
- **P2 - Medium**: Security misconfiguration or policy violation
- **P3 - Low**: Security enhancement or informational finding

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Initial impact and scope determination
3. **Containment**: Immediate actions to limit exposure
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and evidence collection
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and vulnerability remediation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and process improvement

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regular Assessments

- **Monthly**: Automated compliance scanning
- **Quarterly**: Internal security reviews
- **Annually**: Third-party security audit
- **As Needed**: Incident-driven assessments

### Documentation Requirements

- **Security Configurations**: All security settings documented
- **Change Logs**: Complete audit trail of modifications
- **Access Records**: User access and permission history
- **Compliance Evidence**: Artifacts for regulatory requirements

## Security Training and Awareness

### Required Training

- **Security Awareness**: Annual training for all team members
- **Cloud Security**: Platform-specific security training
- **Incident Response**: Quarterly incident response drills
- **Compliance**: Regular updates on regulatory requirements

## Contact Information

- **Security Team**: security@cloudon.work
- **Infrastructure Team**: devops@cloudon.work
- **Compliance Officer**: compliance@cloudon.work

## Updates

This security policy is reviewed quarterly and updated as needed to address new threats and regulatory requirements.
